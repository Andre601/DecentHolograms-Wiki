# General

In DecentHolograms, you can edit almost everything just by commands and editting config files is not required at all. Also, all the commands have Tab-Complete functionality, so it's even easier to use them.

**You can view all commands by using:**

* [ ] /dh help - For general help.
* [ ] /dh holograms help - For help with Holograms related commands.
* [ ] /dh lines help - For help with Hologram Lines related commands.
* [ ] /dh features help - For help with Features related commands.

### Aliases

There is just one, main command that has many subcommands. To speed things up, there are some useful aliases that will make your life easier. These aliases are visible in Help messages and Tab Complete. Some of the most important ones are in the table below.

| (Sub)command name               | Aliases                    |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Main command - /decentholograms | /holograms, /hologram, /dh |
| Hologram  - holograms           | hologram, holo, h          |
| Lines - lines                   | line, l                    |
| Features - features             | feature, f                 |

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, instead of:

`/decentholograms holograms create demo`

You can just use:

`/dh h c demo`
{% endhint %}
