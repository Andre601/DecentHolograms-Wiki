# ðŸ–¥ Setup

## Permissions

DecentHolograms is a plugin specifically designed for server administrators and as such, it simplifies permissions by requiring only one permission node, 'dh.admin', to access all of its features and functionality.

{% hint style="success" %}
dh.admin
{% endhint %}

## Commands

With a wide range of commands, effectively utilizing this plugin may require a basic understanding of some general rules. This will be helpful to work with the commands effectively.

### Arguments

Parenthesis only specify the type of an argument, they are not part of the final command.

| Parenthesis | Meaning                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| <>          | Required argument.       |
| \[]         | Optional argument.       |
| {}          | List of possible values. |

### Tab Completion

The majority of commands and sub-commands feature tab-completion functionality, which can be used to quickly type commands and determine valid values for arguments.

## Editing Holograms

This tutorial provides a basic guide for editing holograms, including instructions for creating and modifying them. For a complete list of commands, please refer to [this page](commands/).

### Create a hologram [\[more\]](commands/hologram.md)

Creating a hologram is easy, simply use the command specified below to get started.

{% hint style="success" %}
/dh create \<name> \[initial content]
{% endhint %}

**TIP!** By default, the hologram will spawn with a single line that reads "Blank Line." You can change the default line content in the [config.yml](configuration/config.md) file or specify the content in the command as shown in the example provided.

### Edit lines [\[more\]](commands/hologram-line.md)

A full list of possible line types and content for hologram lines can be found on [this page](format/).

#### Add a line

{% hint style="success" %}
/dh line add \<hologram> \<page> \<content>
{% endhint %}

#### Set a line

{% hint style="success" %}
/dh line set \<hologram> \<page> \<line> \<content>
{% endhint %}

#### Remove a line

{% hint style="success" %}
/dh line remove \<hologram> \<page> \<line>
{% endhint %}

### Edit pages [\[more\]](commands/hologram-pages.md)

Our holograms support multiple pages, allowing you to add additional content and navigate between them easily.

#### Add a page

{% hint style="success" %}
/dh page add \<hologram>
{% endhint %}

#### Remove a page

{% hint style="success" %}
/dh page remove \<hologram> \<page>
{% endhint %}

### Add another page

You can have as many pages as you'd like.

{% hint style="success" %}
/dh page add example

/dh page switch example 2
{% endhint %}

### Setup actions

To allow players to navigate between pages, you can simply do this:

{% hint style="success" %}
/dh page addaction example 1 RIGHT NEXT\_PAGE

/dh page addaction example 2 LEFT PREV\_PAGE
{% endhint %}

By setting up appropriate click actions, players can navigate between the pages by right-clicking the first page to switch to the next page, and left-clicking the second page to switch back to the first one.

#### You can also switch to a specific page

{% hint style="info" %}
/dh page addaction example 2 RIGHT PAGE:1
{% endhint %}

We offer a variety of click actions, all of which are explained in detail on [this page](actions.md).
