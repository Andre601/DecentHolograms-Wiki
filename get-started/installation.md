# Installation

The first step of getting started will be installing DecentHologram on your server. To do that, follow the tutorial below.

* [ ] Download the plugin jar from [https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/decent-holograms.96927/](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/decent-holograms.96927/)
* [ ] Put the downloaded jar file into the 'plugins' folder on your server.
* [ ] Restart the server.
* [ ] Once the server starts with DecentHolograms.jar in the 'plugins' folder, try using /decentholograms command to make sure the plugin is running.
* [ ] You are done, we hope you enjoy using our plugins.

Optionally, you can also use PlaceholderAPI as it is supported by DecentHolograms.
